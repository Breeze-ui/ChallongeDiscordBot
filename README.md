# ChallongeDiscordBot

Bot which posts events on Discord. When a tournament is about to begin on Challonge.com, it will create channels on Discord with the same name as the URL for the tournament on Challonge. It will ask users on Discord to write `checkin` which creates a link between Discord username, challonge team and a seat number (used for LAN parties). 

When an Challonge administrator has marked a new match as started, it will be posted on Discord, and it will tag the team captains, such that they get an notification that their match is about to start. Meanwhile the participants also knows who they are going to play against and where they are located at the netparty.
